# linear_regression

A simple implementation of Multivariate Linear Regession using Gradient Descent.

Notes:

- Hypothesis is hard code, would be nice to turn it into a closure to be passed into the gradient descent
- No optimisation done, need to make use of the simd framework
- No unit tests written, need to add some
